Okay, let's talk about the UX flow of the website.

First things first the role selection page. there are two options - Writer and Seeker 
Both needs a sign-in/sign-up. (college mail only)

For seeker once the onboarding process (i.e signin and verification) is done take them to browse section where they can find a list of writers with their pricing, department, year and things. The Chat option is given in the div card of the same.

when the click the chat option it will take them to Chat with them option. (need to restrict few words)

then comes the pain :/

UX for Writer

after successful completion  in onboarding it will take them to the dashboard.

How do I design the Dashboard????
